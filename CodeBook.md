Raw data are obtained in UCI Machine Learning Repository with the title : Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
This project consisted on studying the human activity recognition database built from the recording of 30 subjects performing actitvities daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. 

I created for this project a R script called "run_analysis.R" that contain the code allowing to execute the different steps in the aim of obtaining a tidy data.
